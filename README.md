# 🛡️ RealityCheck

**Multi-Modal AI Content & Deepfake Detection MVP**

[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20App-Click%20Here-brightgreen)](https://realitycheck-kzofedkmztvdbpp9ehdmxb.streamlit.app/)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

> RealityCheck is a unified AI-based platform that detects synthetic or manipulated content across **text**, **images**, **audio**, and **video** using state-of-the-art machine learning models.

---

## 📌 Overview

As generative AI content becomes more prevalent, distinguishing between real and AI-generated media is increasingly critical. **RealityCheck** addresses this by offering a **modular, multi-modal deepfake detection system** for:

* 📝 **Text** – Detection of AI-generated writing
* 🖼️ **Images** – Classification of deepfake and synthetic visuals
* 🔊 **Audio** – Detection of voice cloning or audio synthesis
* 🎥 **Video** – Frame-wise analysis to identify deepfake manipulations

Accessible via an intuitive **Streamlit** interface, RealityCheck is designed as a proof of concept (MVP) for fact-checking tools, journalists, forensics experts, and the general public.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

| Modality  | Methodology                                                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text**  | Fine-tuned `roberta-base-openai-detector` model for binary classification (AI vs Human) |
| **Image** | `SigLIP` model via Hugging Face (`open-deepfake-detection`)                             |
| **Audio** | Heuristic energy-based analysis using `torchaudio`                                      |
| **Video** | Frame sampling + image-level fake detection using the same vision pipeline              |
